**Joyce:** Worked on Covid-19 Cases Section.
- In state-data1.js, I changed the data to represent covid-19 data in every borough of NYC instead of data about the states in the U.S.
- In MidTermProj.html, I changed the State Facts Section to a Covid-19 Cases Section. I changed the dropdown to show NYC boroughs instead of states in the U.S. I also changed id values accordingly to correctly display the covid-19 data from state-data1.js.


**Aleef:** Worked on Design/Navigation.
- I created the logo and banner and uploaded to the website
- I also changed color of appropriate elements to suit our color scheme
- I also worked on changing links on navigation bar
